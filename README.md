## Statement about fake UPS-Lite 
hello, first of all, thank you for your support of ups-lite. Recently, I have received feedback from many customers, they bought fake ups-lite, there are many problems, some can not read the accurate battery power value, some battery bulge phenomenon, and some serious damage to pi zero. If you buy a ups-lite like this picture, it says "Designed BY MJ" on the back, then it is a fake ups-lite, and it is recommended to stop using it for safety.
